# ESP 32 Transformer Monitor

This is the code that will control the ESP32.

## Requirements

We will be using PlatformIO for this project. This will allow us to possibly use its remote test and dev features.

## Env variables

Add the env variables to an `.env` file before building it:

```sh
TRANSFORMER_MON_SSID=Your-WiFi-SSID
TRANSFORMER_MON_SSID_PASS=Your-WiFi-Password
# currently has no effect
TRANSFORMER_MON_SERVER=Your-Monitor-server
```
